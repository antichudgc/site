<h2 id="what-is-it-why-would-i-need-one-">What is it? Why would I need one?</h2>
<p>The IFAK is not a first aid kit kit in the traditional sense, being used to treat minor abrasions / burns, but can be thought of as a first aid kit for gunshot or other traumatic injury. The contents are designed to treat life threatening hemorrhage and stabilize the injury until the patient can be transported and treated at a higher level of care. If  you&#39;re regularly at protests or actions where armed people will be present, you should consider carrying an IFAK.</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimum of 1 Tourniquet (CAT is the only type I would recommend) - Most important piece in the kit. Used to stop life threatening blood loss from limbs. Make sure this is staged correctly and ready for use.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="basic-after-the-tourniquet">Basic - After the tourniquet</h3>

<li>Bandages / Pressure dressings - Used to apply pressure and help control bleeding. </li>
<li>Trauma Shears - Used to cut away clothing, gear, etc when required to easily access and treat wounds.</li>
<li>Chest seals - These should come in a pair. Used to seal chest wounds and prevent air from entering the chest cavity. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intermediate-mostly-because-hemostatic-dressing-is-expensive-">Intermediate - Mostly because hemostatic dressing is expensive.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hemostatic dressing - Quikclot Combat Gauze, Celox Z-Fold, etc. You want the dressing not granules.</li>

<p>Do not buy anything from Amazon. Counterfeit products are rampant and this is life saving equipment. If you need to use it, you don&#39;t want to find out it doesn&#39;t work. None of the vendors suggested have undergone any vetting for &quot;anti-chud&quot;-ness. None are openly chuddy, which is basically a win when dealing with firearms and accessories. What they have been vetted for is shipping quality, legit, in-date products that could save your life if you need to use them. </p>
